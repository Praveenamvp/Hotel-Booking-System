# Hotel-Booking-System
The StayWise Hotels project takes a proactive "code-first" approach to enhance the hotel booking process for customers. With a focus on improving user experience, it offers a range of vital features including CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), dynamic filtering for flexibility, precise counting capabilities, and a robust layer of security through JWT token authentication. Furthermore, the project adeptly handles the intricate relationship between hotels and their rooms, accommodating scenarios where a single hotel can offer multiple rooms. StayWise Hotels' vision for this initiative extends beyond security; it aims to elevate customer satisfaction and operational efficiency within the hotel booking domain.
